# YouTube Music API üé∂

üéµ So, this project is like a YouTube Music API built using Express.js üöÄ and a bunch of random Node.js packages üì¶ for YouTube Music stuff. It‚Äôs the main server that gives you a ton of features üåü to play around with YouTube Music‚Äôs goodies üé∂‚Äîall in one place, you know?

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for messing around and testing stuff.

### Prerequisites

- You need Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installing

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/2004durgesh/yt-music-api.git`

2. Install the Node.js stuff: `cd yt-music-api && npm install`

3. Start the server: `node index.js`

Now you can hit up `http://localhost:3000` for the Express.js server.

## API Endpoints üõ£Ô∏è
>[!NOTE]  
>**Quick Note:** In the YouTube URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFQ1EcdTdrI&list=PLRBp0Fe2GpgnRZpKULnyDQv9e_q41M6St`, the YouTube ID is the part after `v=`, which is `vFQ1EcdTdrI`. The playlist ID is after `list=`, which is `PLRBp0Fe2GpgnRZpKULnyDQv9e_q41M6St`. You‚Äôll use these IDs for different API endpoints.
