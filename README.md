# YouTube Music API üé∂

üéµ This project is a robust YouTube Music API built with Express.js üöÄ and a carefully selected set of Node.js packages üì¶ tailored for the YouTube Music ecosystem. As the main server, the API provides a wide range of features üåü, making it easy to interact seamlessly with YouTube Music's extensive resources üé∂‚Äîall in one place.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

### Installing

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/2004durgesh/yt-music-api.git`

2. Install Node.js dependencies: `cd yt-music-api && npm install`

3. Start the Express.js server: `node index.js`

Now you can make requests to `http://localhost:3000` for the Express.js server.

## API Endpoints üõ£Ô∏è
> **Note:** In the YouTube URL `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFQ1EcdTdrI&list=PLRBp0Fe2GpgnRZpKULnyDQv9e_q41M6St`, the YouTube ID is the value after `v=`, which is `vFQ1EcdTdrI` in this case. The playlist ID is the value after `list=`, which is `PLRBp0Fe2GpgnRZpKULnyDQv9e_q41M6St` in this case. These IDs are used in various endpoints of the API.
